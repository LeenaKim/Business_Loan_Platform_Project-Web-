# Corporate Loan Platform Project "BEONE"

## Summary

The “non-face-to-face corporate loan platform Beone” project is a corporate loan platform that can be used by corporations, tax accountants, and banks. It bundles complex corporate loans into one platform and solves everything from document storage and submission, loan application, confirmation, and repayment at once. It is a platform that can. The purpose is to provide a convenient corporate loan service to all corporate and tax accountants, corporate credit managers, and developers.

It provides a non-face-to-face subscription service, which was not seen in the existing Hana Bank corporate loan platform, and allows you to submit loan documents with a tax accountant who has undergone corporate certification. It can save you the hassle.

In addition, the Beone platform is convenient for corporate credit managers who need to approve new loans because AI trained by machine learning informs the appropriate interest rate of loan applicants. An appropriate level of interest rate is determined based on a company's net income, operating profit, debt, and creditworthiness, and the Bank of Korea can set the interest rate and limit based on this.

Finally, the Beone platform is also convenient for developers. Since it runs on the private cloud installed with Openstack, it is easy to separate tasks and it is easy for developers to manage servers and instances. Also, since it is a server running on a private IP, it is excellent in terms of security.`
